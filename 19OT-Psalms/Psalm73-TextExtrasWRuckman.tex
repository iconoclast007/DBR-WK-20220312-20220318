He is a ``singer'' in 1 Chronicles 15:19 who handles cymbals. When David writes something, he often “delivers” it to Asaph (1 Chronicles 16:7), and the reason for this is that Asaph does not just bang cymbals together; he is said to be able to ``prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals,'' as well (1 Chron. 25:1). Psalm 50 is “a Psalm of Asaph,” and now his name appears on the first of eleven Psalms ascribed to him (Ps. 73–83). Since Asaph can “prophesy,” he is called a “seer” in 2 Chronicles 29:30. There will be no doubt left about Asaph’s ability to prophesy by the time we have plowed through Psalms 74, 75, and 76.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}} \footnote{[RUCKMAN] The theme of this Psalm, plainly, is the worldly prosperity of the wicked with which the saints must deal in this life; hence, the Psalm is loaded with devotional material. Doctrinally, the “ungodly” of verse 12 (and the “wicked,” vs. 3) is a reference to the Antichrist’s people in the Tribulation. This is apparent by their prophesied “end” (vs. 17) which cannot be said of millions of ungodly people in the Church Age. But as we have said, the material is largely devotional, so Davidson, Briggs, Duhm, Ewald, Hupfeld, Baethgen, and Dummelow shouldn’t have to tear it up so badly with “rathers” and “betters,” and Motyer, Lange, Clarke, Ellicott, Kroll, Yates, Jamieson, Fausset, Brown, and other “common taters” shouldn’t have to flip and flop, bluff and bluster, and blow and “side wind” to get through the Psalm. “Truly God is good to Israel....” When? Between 1933 and 1945? “Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart” (see Ps. 24:4), but the man in the text had a clean heart, and God was “beatin’ the stuffin’ out of him” (vs. 14). You  see, the Book is always deeper than it looks. Of course we can spiritualize. We can say that a true “Israelite” is one inside (Rom. 2:29), whose heart has been purified by faith (Acts 15:9). We note further that envy (vs. 3) came to Israel when they were provoked to jealousy “by a foolish nation” (Rom. 10:19). Envy is uncleanness of heart. Asaph, in Christian vernacular, is about to “backslide” (or more properly, “get out of fellowship with God”) for his feet and his “steps” are about to trip him up. His stumblingblock is envy—the root sin of Satan (Isa. 14:14); the sin that caused the murder of Jesus Christ (Mark 15:10). Envy is a major cause of backsliding. In the New Testament, it is the mark of the “carnal” Christian (1 Cor. 3:3). The elder brother (whom Christ used to picture a lawabiding Pharisee; Luke 15:29) can’t stand to see the publicans and harlots (typified by the younger) getting saved and celebrating. It eats his guts out. Envy caused the death of Abel, the murder of Naboth, and the attempted assassination of David (1 Sam. 18:10--11), as well as the damnation of the Jews who tried to stop the Gentiles from believing on Christ (Acts 13:45 and 1 Thess. 2:15--16). “Who is able to stand before envy?” (Prov. 27:4). (Look at Rachel’s case: Gen. 30:1.) Envy runs rampant among four classes of Americans: opera singers, movie stars, radio (or TV) announcers, and preachers. Any position that puts a man in the spotlight produces envy in sinners who want the spotlight. Examples are too numerous even to list. Many times the motive for building a church, building a youth camp, promoting a soulwinning campaign, or building a “record breaking Sunday School” is simply jealousy: someone else had won more souls, had a better attendance, had better facilities,  etc.  It is ENVY, pure envy, and nothing but envy, that supports the lifetime ministries of more than a thousand Bible-correcting scholars in America and England. The RV, ASV, NASV, RSV, NRSV, NIV, and NKJV were produced by one basic motive, and it had nothing to do with anyone “understanding” anything. It had to do with the fact that every backslidden, dead orthodox, dry eyed, codfishy, apostate Conservative in the world has never been used of God from the day he began to correct the Book till the day that he died, so he resented the men in his day that God really used, who stuck by the Book. No deader people ever lived on this earth than A. T. Robertson, Hort, J. G. Machen, Trench, Schaff, Vincent, Thayer, Rendall, Ryle, Kutilek, Custer, Panosian, Wisdom, Bob Jones IV, Robert Sumner, Dell, Sherman, Martin, Farstad, Hodges, and Willmington. All mouth, no fruit. All profession, no results. Not one soulwinning, street preaching prayer warrior in the lot. They lived off the reputations they developed by being associated with some who were.  Do you know why this crew (the Alexandrian Cult) literally “flips” their lid when they have to face the fact that at eighty years old this author is still winning more adults to Christ in a month than they ever do in five years, and is still having five to ten young men called to preach every twelve months he is “on the road”? It is because not one man in the list could get one red blooded male over eighteen years old to follow him to McDonald’s for a free meal. When they see 300--500 young, male, Bible believers following my teachings, they have a “conniption fit” and can only holler, “Cult! Cult! Cult! Following a man! Following a man!” They do this because no one would follow them fifteen feet in broad daylight. Their “followers” are corporation followers who follow an institution or a corporate establishment. Jealousy. Personally, these men are so vacillating, mealy mouthed, and anemic that no real male would take them hunting. Sometimes I have been envious of their corporations. I used to live in the middle of the PCC “campus”—they owned all the land around me on all four sides. When I saw their magnificent dormitories, landscaped gardens and driveways, athletic fields, fieldhouses, palm trees, elevators, “high risers,” and acreage (almost a square mile), I said to myself, “Well, Lord, it’s your Book, and if you want it taught on five acres of a hillside with tin buildings and no dorms, ‘Thy will be done.’” But I have often felt just a little “slighted” when I see how many young men have been suckered into PCC by waving the world in front of their faces—and that is what anyone’s acreage and buildings are. I wave a Book in front of their face. They come to me believing the Book, and they leave believing the Book, and they never again follow a man who doesn’t believe the Book. My 100--150 students look pretty thin alongside the student bodies of PCC, BJU, and others, but I know what they had to do to get those student bodies. Boy, do I know what they had to do! I would never be willing to do it, so there is no sense in begrudging them anything. “The prosperity of the wicked.” The richest people in America are crooked businessmen and Hollywood entertainers. The wealthy folks are drunks like Bing Crosby or Errol Flynn, dopeheads like the rock stars, fornicators like Eddie Murphy, sluts like Madonna and Liz Taylor, or “neuters” like Michael Jackson and Rock Hudson. Saddam Hussein never had to worry about cleaning out a septic tank or changing a light bulb; neither did J. Paul Getty, Howard Hughes, Ted Turner, Adolph Hitler, Pope John Paul II, or Oral Roberts.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

The trouble (as usual) is “heart trouble” (vs. 21). The thing that controls the man (“reins,” see Ps. 7:9) is aggravated, so that he kicks “against the pricks” (Acts 9:5). I think, “How is it that I cannot get a gospel tract in German, printed in full color, when it is only five inches by three inches, while on the newsstand, every month, there are five 90 page pornographic magazines (8x11 in.) in full color?” I think, “How is it that I cannot publish a book of 208 paintings on the book of Revelation—which has never been done on this earth—when Walden Books carry anywhere from ten to thirty books of paintings that deal with nothing but nature or humanism?” “My heart was grieved.” I see young men in my classes trying to “make ends meet”; some of them with two and three children to raise. One of them was a blind boy, and two students attended on crutches. Two of my students were soaked with hospital bills over \$12,000 when their salaries were less than five dollars an hour. I have had students who walked more than two miles to school—sometimes in the rain—and I have had students who literally ate nothing but peanut butter sandwiches for four months at a time; they couldn’t afford anything else. “Grieved...so foolish was I, and ignorant.” Hard to lay hold of, isn’t it? I had one student whose wife died on him and left him with four children; to heat his small house, he had to cut an oil drum in half and burn charcoal in it. At one time, PCC tore down more than a dozen houses worth \$30,000 to \$70,000 apiece, and they simply hauled them off to make room for some pretty grass.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

If you are going to do wrong, you can get dessert NOW, and these days that is exactly what most Christian “celebrities” do. Their god is their ministry, so as all pragmatic humanists, they will “use” or “prefer” anything that will help their attendance, image, or enrollment: i.e.,dollars. Spurgeon can’t stand the Holy Bible so he alters the word “I” (vs. 23) to “he” (Treasury, p. 265). The Living Bible alters it to “you.” Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown alter it to “thee.” Now you can take your pick, like any good humanistic pragmatist: “choose the alternative lifestyle that is meaningful to you in a pluralistic society.” Take “I,” “he,” “you,” or “thee.” How about “they,” “we,” “us,” or “them”? Why stop when you have a good thing going? The Hebrew Masoretic text reads as the King James: “I am continually....” Imagine! “Thou art continually with THEE,” or “He art continually with THEE, “ or “You art continually with YOU.” There is nothing like a seminary education to make a perfect blockhead out of a nincompoop. I like the way Kyle Yates handles it: “he refused to parade his doubt lest he influenced others adversely...God is his guide and strength...the psalmist emphasizes the sense of God’s nearness as he experiences it in his present circumstances.” Ain’t that a flip? How is that for “off the wall?” Try it this way: “The psalmist, realizing that God is God and can help folks out, decides to ask God to help him out so he won’t have to help himself out.” Nothing like a “deep Bible study,” is there? The psalmist (if you want the truth of the matter) is still with God in spirit and mind, even when unable to understand the things described in the preceding verses. “I’m with YOU, Lord!” Watch Simon Peter expound the text: “I don’t understand one cotton pickin’ thing you said about eating blood, because that is a violation of the Law, and I don’t even eat catfish because of Leviticus 10; but I’m with ya’, Lord. I’m sticking with you (John 6:66--68). You can count on me! (Luke 22:33) ‘I am continually with thee!’” The English often sheds some light on the silly and superstitious faculty members at BJU, BBC, Wheaton, Fuller, Moody, PCC, and Tennessee Temple.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

If Mary is in heaven now, she would do well to keep her mouth shut except when praising the Lamb (Rev. 5:8--14, 7:11--12). “And there is none upon earth,” father, mother, wife, sister, brother, son, or daughter (!), “that I desire beside thee.” If this is literal and doctrinal, then Asaph is speaking for Jesus Christ in verses 23--26, and this would completely explain “I am continually with thee” in verse 23. This is probably the case, for it is more than manifest that when Spurgeon hits verse 25, he cannot apply the second clause. The help that he enlists to explain it (Joseph Caryl and Christian Scriver) give us a vague, generalized “spread” that would cover everything except the words “none that I desire.” The author of verse 25 is fulfilling the first commandment as applied by Jesus Christ in Luke 14:26. Here, God is loved ahead of family, relatives, and friends. This is the first commandment in practice.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

Job said what was “right” about God (Job 42:7), even though his buddies didn’t agree (Job 32:3). Well, old Baethgen would change the wording of verses 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 26. Duhm doesn’t like verses 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 25. Briggs alters 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, etc. Ewald, Hitzig, Olhausen, and Dillman believe verse 4 should read “sound and stalwart is their strength.”
Gesenius, Hupfeld, Cheyne, and Bickell want verse 9 to say “from the heart their iniquity cometh forth,” and verse 17 should have Asaph entering the “mysteries” instead of the sanctuary (DeWette, Ewald, Hitzig). The New English Bible made seventy five nice, little, neat changes in the Psalm, and the rest of the rubbish—the NIV, RSV, ASV, NASV, NRSV—did just about as good. The NIV says “their tongues take possession of the earth,” thus destroying the advanced revelation on electromagnetic waves. Typical. Black light from the pit. All the “black holes” are not in outer space.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }
