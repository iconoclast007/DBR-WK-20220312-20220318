I use it extensively in a chalk talk called “Growing Old Gracefully.” Personally, I never thought I would ever be able to claim such a Psalm, for I never expected to live more than forty years, or forty-five at the most. Sinners who lived like I lived are entitled to “life spans” about the length of John Lennon, John Belushi, Jimmy Hendrix, Elvis Presley, or (at a maximum) Errol Flynn. But God in His mercy brought me up to the full “threescore years and ten” (Ps. 90:10) so I know what verses 2, 6, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17, and 18 are all about.  Verse 1 is self-explanatory. Unfortunately, we
are often “put to confusion” when we don’t follow the Lord’s instructions and leadership. I
have met many a real Christian in jail (1980–-1997) who confessed that God had to put him
there to “get his attention.”\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

All is evident. No commentator should have any trouble at all with anything in the first eight verses; all is devotional and practical. Since Kroll (as other immature milk sops like James Combs) cannot apply anything that David says in verse 4–12 to anything he knows anything about, he limits the contents to saying “he” instead of “YOU,” and “him” instead of “US,” and refers to the “Psalmist” instead of the reader who is reading the Psalm. It is remarkable to note that when these milk sops hit a passage that is aimed doctinally at someone else (Ps. 9:11, 10:16, 14:4, for example), they immediately apply it spiritually to themselves or the reader (“us” or “our”). A perfect acid rain of scholarly pollution. It is like the disciples making it LITERAL when it was figurative (Matt. 16:6–8), and then spiritualizing it when it was LITERAL (Matt. 15:15–18). Today, you would have to sit at the feet of a Jesuit priest to get the Bible that screwed up.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

True in Christ’s case, but also true in Paul’s case (Acts 28:6), Peter’s case (Acts 12:18), and in the case of any man in any century who goes against the spirit of his “times” and swims upstream against the current of his age. Martin Luther was a wonder to the point of shock to the Europeans of the sixteenth century. J. Frank Norris was a wonder beyond comprehension to the Texans of 1920--1950. General William Booth was a walking wonder on two legs, and so was Billy Bray, George Whitefield, John Wesley, Billy Sunday, Dwight Moody, Sam Jones, and any other man who believed and preached a King James Bible all of his life. “Wonder” in this case is “how in the world does that good-for-nothing nut survive, as fanatical and as negative as he is?” Note: “but thou art my strong refuge.” “One man and God is a majority” (Bob Jones Sr.). The world’s present opinion of the true saints (which matches the opinions of most of the contemporary professing Christians of their day) is that they are anti-social, unbalanced, prejudiced, trouble makers (Acts 17:6), heretics (Acts 24:14), and dangerous for unsophisticated people to listen to. The religious and intellectual “establishment ” always wants the final authority (their opinions) to be reverenced in any contemporary set-up that they control. King James I was certainly “the wonder of the world,” as he still is today. How could God use such a sorry wimp to produce the greatest Book that has ever showed up on this earth? The modern “establishment” (The Scholar’s Union, which we call “The Alexandrain Cult”) solves this problem by using the Book without believing it (Curtis Hutson, James Combs, Bob Jones IV, et al.). They also recommend it while recommending themselves as superior to it. Note in verse 6 that life is given to an individual so that he may praise God “continually.” This means that Charles Darwin, Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, Elvis Presley, Johnny Carson, Ted Kennedy, Mikhail Gorbachev, Saddam Hussein, FDR, Lenin, Stalin, Marx, Madonna, Frank Sinatra, Bill Cosby, and Winston Churchill defeated the purpose for which they were born. The same thing may be said of 90 percent of the world’s population.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

(Prov. 16:31). Watchman Nee aged years before his time, but he was proud of his wrinkles and white hairs; they had been produced by torture and persecution for standing for the truth.  “The time of old age...when my strength faileth”: My physical strength (see Isa. 46:4 where the prayer is answered). Isaiah 40:31 shows how to prolong this physical strength. Moses, Caleb, and Joshua are the Biblical illustrations (see Deut. 34:7 and Joshua 14:10–12). Historically speaking, David knows that he is “failing” when he nearly gets killed in combat (see 2 Sam. 21:15--17); up till then, he never needed any help. When he led Jewish troops into battle he even took on the Syrians (2 Sam. 8:5, 10:10). He stomped them into a mudhole and didn’t waste \$40,000,000,000 of his country’s money “holding exercises” near the Persian Gulf to try to impress the News Media and give them something to talk about (August-December, 1990). “Proper makeup may take years off a woman’s life, but you can’t fool a flight of stairs.’’ “How you doin’, old man? Still kickin’?” “Well yes, but I’m not raisin’ much dust anymore.” “Sir,” says a thirty-five-year-old radio news reporter, “I have enjoyed interviewing you on your one hundred and first birthday. I do hope that I will be able to interview you on your birthday next year.” “Wal, I don’t know why not, young fella. You look perfectly healthy to me.” One of the Chief Justices (who had just turned eighty) was walking to lunch one day with a fellow judge, and as a ravishing young secretary passed them he was heard to say, “Oh to be sixty again!” Some men die at forty and are buried at eighty. But the cane comes (1 Kings 2:2), the hearing aids come, the eyeglasses come, the “bridges” and “plates” come, and eventually, even men like John Wesley (over eighty-one) deteriorate into a feverish, tottering, lisping, absentminded relics of the men they once were. No one wants to get old. “Never grow old, never grow old, in that land where we’ll never grow old!” There is nothing more repulsive in this world than an old man still courting this world long after she has turned him down. Bob Jones Sr. got to where he was telling the same illustration three times in one sermon. Estes Pirkle can barely hobble around; Carl Lackey went on trying to hold a congregation together long after he had lost the ability to handle it. Gerald Fleming is smitten with Altzheimer’s disease, and his memory is gone. Billy Graham’s voice began to tremble; Dr. DeHaan goes “abed” and doesn’t rise again. The once flashing eyes, thunderous voice, the ramrod back, and blazing delivery of someone like J. Frank Norris, B. B. Crimm, or W. B. Riley are eventually reduced to a worn-out frame, racked with chills, fever, clogged  circulation, and collapsed lungs; the back is bent, the eyes are dulled, the voice quivers, and the lungs gasp for air: “forsake me not when my strength faileth.” “For mine enemies” are God’s enemies, so God should be interested in giving me strength “as thy days” (Deut. 33:25).\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

That is what Jackie Kennedy cried when her husband got bullets in several parts of his anatomy (Dallas, 1963). She doesn’t “Hail Mary” long enough to wake the Queen of Heaven up, and she forgets all about her “Our Fathers,” if she ever had one.

Testament “witnesses” (Acts 1:8). Psalm 107:2 is
a commandment in regard to this, although the
doctrinal context is the redeemed of Israel. The
moral lesson is clear: praise God while you can
because you don’t know how long you will have
to praise Him (“I know not the numbers
thereof”). The standard “allotted time” is seventy
years (Ps. 90:10), but these can be cut short (Eccl.
7:17) or lengthened (Isa. 38:5), thus completely
contradicting Calvin’s theological system. David’s
captivity is decreed as certain (1 Sam. 23:12), but
it doesn’t even take place (1 Sam. 23:13). Calvin
had some problems!\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

We have no strength of our own, for “no good thing” dwells in our flesh (Rom. 7:18). “I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.” Good Pauline “one body” doctrine for the “mystery-of-the-one-body.” David practices the first clause when faced with Goliath; Paul practices the second clause when he faces Agrippa (Acts 26:26, 29). We are to practice both clauses. Our “plan of salvation” doesn’t match the Roman Catholic plan of any pope. They speak of Mary’s righteousness and the righteousness of their own parishoners who are trying to die in a “state of grace.” We junk the whole corrupt crew. We say that if a sinner is saved by grace through faith, he is kept by grace through faith and “through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ” (to quote the “first pope“—Simon Peter, Acts 15:11). He will be saved more surely than he can count on the sun coming up in the morning: it has been known to fail several times (Exod. 10:22). We don’t give a flip about Mary’s “sinless conception” or her “sinless life” or her “sinless death.” If she was “sinless,” she still isn’t worth giving “the time of day to” according to the twelve apostles. We speak of “God’s righteousness” (Rom. 10:4) and His righteousness “only” (1 Tim. 2:5). Mary isn’t going to win, place, or show; she is not even in the race.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

was once “young,” but now “old” (Ps. 37:25)
that God Himself was his real instructor from start
to finish. From his mother’s “womb” (vs. 6) and
his birth (vs. 6) into his sixties and seventies,
David testifies that he has had help superior to his
own brains or the brains of his peers. “Thank
God, gentlemen,” says Lord Chesterfield, “that we
have something more reliable than our own brains
to count on.” But that’s all that any Darwinian
monkey-man has. He is the “measure” of
pollution, poverty, disease, taxes, robbery,
murder, war, sin, death, hell, blasphemy,
perversion, and chaos: truly “the measure of ALL
things.” It is God who teaches a man things He
does not teach animals (Job 35:11). The first man
did not invent planting, plowing, sowing, reaping,
