\textbf{Introduction:} King David wrote 73 of the hundred and fifty divisions of Psalms. This one is simply addressed to the chief musician, but the writing of the song is reminiscent of the king.  David was well known for using many personal pronouns in his songs, like "I" and "my". After all God was his personal Savior and he was not ashamed to identify and to share his faith.  Here the writer wishes to express what God has done in his own personal life. Your testimony is the most powerful thing you have as a witness tool.
