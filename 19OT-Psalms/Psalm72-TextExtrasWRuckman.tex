The last Psalm in the second collection of Psalms deals with the “new birth” of the earth, called “the regeneration” in Matthew 19:28. Very little in the Psalm is figurative, and it is the most fitting Psalm for David to write as a close for his “prayers” (vs. 20), for it is the literal fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant which God made with him in 2 Samuel 7:10--l6. With this as clear as a cloudless sky in Montana at twelve noon, you know what to expect from the majority of “good, godly, qualified, recognized milk sops” who taught the faculties and staffs at Wheaton, BJU, Moody, BBC, Fuller, Pensacola Christian Schools, Tennessee Temple, Dallas Theological Seminary, and Liberty University all they thought they knew. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown finally admit that there will be a literal reign of Christ on earth sometime, but they are so afraid of the “Millennial” issue that they do not dare to tell you how long the reign will be or when it will begin. In their discussion (in which they cite around fifty verses) they never mention Revelation 20:1--6. Kroll—being connected with Jerry Falwell— has to identify it: it is the Millennial reign of Christ. But notice that although Kroll finally “found himself” and got his “bearings,” he missed them in Psalm 2:6, 3:7, 7:7, 9:5--6, 11, 11:1–6, 15:1, 26:6, 29:10, 36:8, and two dozen other places. Kyle Yates is as lost as a goose in a horserace: “This is the prayer of a loyal subject who desires God’s richest blessing upon a young king $\hdots$ There is, throughout, a picture of an ideal king, and thus the psalm has Messianic significance...the verbs translated as futures may express prophetic confidence, or be better rendered as prayers $\hdots$ better rendered ‘may he live’...the verbs in verses are probably indicatives...and mark out the public rewards arising from his ideal characteristics...a number of manuscripts do not include verse 20 here.”\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

Just one vast expanse of cactus, tumbleweeds, sand, dust, rocks, gravel, and heat waves as far as the eye can see. “David is the writer, and Solomon is the subject” (Dummelow). “Some actual ruler--Solomon, Hezekiah, or another—is no doubt in view $\hdots$ applicable only to the perfect divine King, though it is nowhere expressly quoted in this sense in the New Testament...LXX and Vulgate render verse 6 as ‘upon a fleece’ $\hdots$ The metaphor of verse 6 is continued...He shall live BETTER $\hdots$ may he live...‘prayer shall be made ever unto him’ is an indefensible translation which has arisen from an exclusive reference of the Psalm to Christ $\hdots$ these verses are best read as a prayer (16--17).” Dummelow makes no comment on verses 11, 13, 18, 19--20 and alters verses 8, 12, 16--17 with the RV of Westcott and Hort. Motyer, The New Bible Commentary, steps up with a mouth full of mush, a brain full of cobwebs, and both hands filled with “original Hebrew texts” and Hebrew lexicons and bluffs his way through in this fashion: “The kingly rule which is the theme of the POEM is certainly described IDEALISTICALLY, a common feature of the royal psalms...and attains a VISION of Christ; seeing that in him the helpless find the powerful Redeemer...the balance of meaning of these words being that the former stresses character and moral principle, the latter administration and moral practice $\hdots$ once more it is an easy transition to the divine Messiah who LIVES and REIGNS for ever.” Postmillennialism; just as rotten as Hymenaeus and Alexander ever taught it (2 Tim. 2:17--18). Spurgeon handles it the same way (p. 226): “Jesus is here, beyond all doubt, in the glory of His reign, both as He NOW is and as he shall be revealed in the latter day glory.” Half truths; half baked and half sliced to please both those who believe the Book and those who “use” it without believing it. Alexander Grosse says that the kings of verse 10 will give money in the church offering to help “Christ’s church” out (Treasury, p. 237). The mountains don’t change at all (vs. 3). This is just a “figure” to show that more than a “few” folks will have peace (Mollerus), and no one prays to Jesus Christ but only “through him” (Jonathan Edwards). The nations that “call Him blessed” are all converted in this age (during WWI, WWII, the Civil War, the War of 1812, the French Revolution, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, etc.) by the “gospel” (Murphy, 1863). Go back to the Book. The majority of Conservative scholars have always been wrong and will always be wrong everytime they alter one word in the AV text in order to cover up their infidelity or stupidity. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}
\begin{compactenum}
\item The King’s Son is the “Son of David” (Matt. 1:1). \item He will JUDGE when He comes (Matt. 25:31).
\item The mountains will bring forth peace in the sense that they will produce crops that you wouldn’t believe (vs. 16). They will be the scene of Christ’s Advent (Mount Paran, Mount Seir, Mount Sinai, and the Mount of Olives). The “beautiful” feet (Isa. 52:7) of Moses and Elijah appear on these mountains in the Tribulation. All of the commentators, including all the Premillennialists, missed all of the references. Most of them had to retranslate “peace” as “prosperity” (see the NIV, RSV, and NRSV).
\item The “oppressor” (vs. 4) is broken to pieces (see Ps. 68:21).
\item The “poor and needy” fear God to the end of the Millennium (vs. 5).
\item Christ returns at the Feast of Tabernacles with a two-season downpour coming at one time (see the voluminous list of cross references under Ps. 68:9, which all of the
Premillennialists missed, including Isaiah 45:8 and 44:3).
\item “The righteous,” verse 7, are the “righteous” of Matthew 13:43, and the context is the same. All of the Premillennial commentators missed both references because they thought that Old Testament salvation under the law and Tribulation salvation were identical with Church Age salvation. Typical of this irresponsible, depraved mishandling of the Scriptures was James Combs’ editorial in the Baptist Bible Tribune (Nov., 1990) where he referred to scriptural truth about these matters as being “off the wall.” He actually judged the Scriptures by the standard of his own stupidity.
\item The “dominion” of verse 8 is the literal, physical, geo-political land grant given to Abraham in Genesis, chapter 15. It was illustrated in a book written in 1929 by Clarence Larkin (Dispensational Truth, enlarged and rev. ed. [Glenside, PA: Rev. Clarence Larkin Estate, 1929]).
\end{compactenum} 
There was not one thing difficult in the entire passage; nothing needed to be spiritualized or taken as figurative. Every verse in it dealt with a period of time whose beginning is known and whose end is known, at least to those who have copies of the Scripture which they can read.}

Of course, we all know that in this age our Lord “delivers, spares, saves, and redeems” (vss. 12--14) but that is NOT the doctrinal or historic position of the verses. Of course, we all know that Christ’s “name” will endure through the church age as well as eternity (vs. 17), and who doesn’t know that in eternity all nations will “call him blessed”? But verse 17 is talking primarily about the Millennium that goes into eternity later (see comments under Gen. 2:1–2 in the Commentary on Genesis).\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}

\item The Arabians will bow down to Him at Jerusalem (vs. 9), and his enemies will literally put their faces in the DIRT at His feet (Ps. 110:1; Isa. 49:23).
\item The kings of Arabia and Spain will bring gifts to Him, as the Queen of Sheba did to Solomon; which, by the way, is the definitive type in 1 Kings, chapter 10. Look at Isaiah 45:14 and 60:6-–16.
\item Verses 13 and 14 come out of the Tribulation half-starved and escaping by ``the skin of their teeth.''
\item Christ will be praised daily, and incense will be offered to Him daily (Mal. 1:11); consequently, He will be prayed for and to daily (Ps. 65:2). Look at Isaiah 56:7.
\item The sun continues in eternity (vss. 5, 17 with Ps. 89:36), although it is not needed in New Jerusalem in eternity (Rev. 21:23). All of the commentators fail to grasp the distinction.
\item Corn will be so abundant in the Millennium (see Amos 9:13 and Isa. 62:8--9) that just a handful of seed will produce stalks growing twenty to thirty feet high (see Isa. 29:17, 35:1; and Rom. 8:19--23); see Isa. 51:3 and 44:3--4.

The earth is to be an international KILLING GROUND for bloodletters until this time comes. Nothing can alter this sixty century-old truth. ``Today’s Special, K-Mart shoppers, is ‘In case of rain, the war will be held in the auditorium’.'' The ``enriched curriculum'' for this ``pluralistic society'' is bigger and better wars. No peace without the Prince of Peace, no Kingdom without the King, no crown without the cross, no hope without God and the Book.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}
