[24] For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. [25] My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. [26] The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. [27] All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. [28] For the kingdom is the LORDâ€™S: and he is the governor among the nations. [29] All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.}\footnote{\textbf{Psalm 61:5} -For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.}
