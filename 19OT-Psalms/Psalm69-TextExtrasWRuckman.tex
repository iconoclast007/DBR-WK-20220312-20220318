Some bereavements are not over in a month or two, or a year or two. At the moment I write, there are prison cells, hospital beds, torture chambers, and bedrooms where the tears run till they can run no more. Life is a vale of tears. Note that verse 3 describes Christ on the cross: “My throat is dried.” Waiting for God in this case, mens waiting until the Resurrection. On the cross He is ridiculed for waiting in vain (Matt 27:39--43). Note how the Holy Spirit will switch from Christ to David, back to Christ “at the drop of a hat,” thus confounding the commentators. Verse 5 is David. Verses 6 and 7 go right back to Jesus Christ. Of verse 6 we may say that we can pray for success on the basis of the need of sinners to confirm God’s words and His promises. Elijah at Carmel is a good example (1 Kings 18:36--37). \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

A man who has not made a fool out of himself for Christ after his conversion is a coward. Paul says he had better become a “fool” that he might be wise (1 Cor. 3:18). One of the most distressing and revolting thoughts that can occur to anyone who has watched the leaders of Fundamentalism in America today, is that none of them can stand ridicule; all of them fear ridicule worse than death. They go out of their way to maintain a sort of “News Media image” before the Body of Christ. They must always appear pious, cool, regulated, controlled, objective, scholarly, “nice,” high class, and “Biblical.” And they will go to any length (and make any compromise) to preserve this “cool” image. If you were to say to anyone of them, “When was the last time you made a fool out of yourself for Christ’s sake?” most of them could not point to two times since the date of their conversion. There are exceptions of course, but the exceptions (like Bob Gray, Bruce Cummons, Karl Lackey, John Mitchell, Tim Green, Alex Dunlap, Jack Chick, et al.) are few and far between. Are you going to be a Christian for twenty to fifty years who dies and hits the Judgment Seat of Christ with nothing on your record but the times you made a fool out of yourself over a woman, or a bottle, or a needle, or a pill, or the government, or your buddies, or a buck? What a God-awful thing to have to do! If the wisdom of this world is “foolishness” with God, what are you doing mouthing off about “sharing, caring, coping, thrust, focus, meaningful, summit, touching, relating, life style, role model, values, etc.”? \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  
\begin{compactenum}
\item Has anyone ridiculed you in a church or a school for believing the Bible?
\item Has anyone mocked you in public for preaching on the street?
\item Has anyone threatened you physically as an individual (never mind that corporate crap  —“slandered our godly institution,” “opposed our publication,” etc.) for telling them they were going to hell?
\item Has anyone cussed you out right to your face for witnessing?
\end{compactenum}
In view of what Lester Roloff went through and what Solzhenitsyn, Wurmbrand, John Noble, and Haralan Popov went through, what will YOU show up with at the Judgment Seat of Christ, having lived in America in the twentieth century? “My sins are not hid from thee.” No one’s are (Eccl. 12:14 and Rom. 2:16). The big ones and the little ones, and the medium-sized ones, internal and external (1 Chron. 28:9), are all “opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do” (Heb. 4:13).}

This is the greatest intentional slap in the face that a religious hypocrite ever received from God, and there is nothing even in Matthew chapter 23 or Jeremiah chapter 23 that could match it. Here, before your eyes, is a statement by the Holy Spirit that every Roman Catholic nun, priest, monk, bishop, archbishop, cardinal, and pope alive (on any continent) is a bald-faced liar. Here is a statement by the Holy Spirit which says the first “excathedra” statement that came “infallibly” from the lips of Pope Pius IX was an unholy and ungodly LIE. The pope is a liar, and so is anyone who trusts his first excathedra statement in “matters of faith and morals.” For here we are told that Mary was NOT a perpetual virgin (vs. 8). Moreover, her children were NOT Christ’s cousins or even His kinsmen. They were her sons by Joseph (see Mark 6:3): “my mother’s children.” The speaker is Jesus Christ. You say, “How do they deal with this?” They don’t. You are to accept these godless, Catholic private interpretations as revelations of the Spirit working through them. This has been the teaching of the Roman Catholic hierarchy ever since it adopted the blasphemy that water could regenerate sinners (Augustine, A.D. 415). Observe how the Holy Spirit interpreted verse 9 by applying it to Jesus Christ in the New Testament (John 2:17). As if Mark 6:4 were not clear enough—“country...kin...house”—God told the lying Roman Catholics that Christ’s “mother” (Ps. 69:8) had other “children.” James was his brother despite the Scofield notes trying to convert James into a cousin. Moral: never trust a Roman Catholic priest, bishop, or Pope as far as you can kick a rosary with your belly button. They are confirmed liars, and have been confirmed in their habitual lying for more than thirteen centuries. They are not going to repent now or later. By far the most remarkable thing about the exposition on the passage is the delicate handling of Mary’s children so as not to offend Catholic blasphemers. Spurgeon even prints the comments of a certain one (W. Greenfield, The Comprehensive Bible) where the relationships are denied by applying it (vs. 8) to David only. Kroll recognizes “the younger children of Mary” but will not give you their names and will not tell you that every Biblical text of Psalm 69, from every set of manuscripts used for every copy of every edition of every translation for 1900 years, says that Roman Catholics are idolatrous liars. Kyle Yates (Golden Gate BAPTIST Theological Seminary) will not even mention the passage, let alone comment on it. Motyer says, “people of all ranks, his brothers,” and drops the matter. You must understand that every one of these softshoe shufflers with their delicacy and tender tact write more than seventy years after the official public proclamation of the Pope (Pius IX) that Mary was born sinless and remained a perpetual virgin after Christ’s birth. “Because for thy sake” (vs. 7). This is the Lord Jesus talking. He is bearing the “reproaches” (see vs. 9) that were aimed at God the Father. Rejection of Christ is rejection of God the Father (Matt. 11:27; John 1:18, 5:19–23; 1 John 2:23). “Shame hath covered my face.” They are spitting on Him (Isa. 50:6); they are slapping Him in the face (Mark 15:18–19), and finally they take all His clothes off Him (John 19:23) and hang Him up naked (“Shame hath covered my face”). “Brethren” (vs. 8): there are the cousins, nephews, nieces, aunts, and uncles, or whatever. “Mother’s children”: there are James, Joses, Juda, and Simon (Mark 6:3), completely contrary to what every Roman Catholic in your town was taught, including all your family, all your friends, and all your relatives. I did not attack your religion. I did not “slander” your church. I did not write “hate literature” about you. It was the Third Person of the Godhead that made a liar out of you, your faith, your friends, your family, your church, your pope, and your religion. The Author of the Book showed that all of you were liars. Fight it out with Him. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

Not only was the Lord Jesus zealous for the Lord’s “household” but also for the literal “house”-- the temple (John 2:15, 21). It was His holy rage (John 2:15) that caused Him to jeopardize His life with the Jewish religious leaders.

You are back on David again, who was known to have done this (see 2 Sam. 3:31), but the Messianic applications don’t stop. “I became a proverb...I was the song of the drunkards.” This is literal. You can find those who mock and hate Jesus Christ in every strata of society. The popes all make him a liar for saying that Mary had other children (see above), for throwing out the Apocrypha (see Matt 23:35 and Luke 24:44), and for attacking their theology on “mediators” (1 Tim. 2:15) and the Mass (Heb. 10:10--12). Their profession of “love for the Lord” is, in truth and fact, a love for a fictitious Christ and a fictitious Mary that exist only in the imaginations of church fathers who corrected the Book. Spiritually speaking, the “song of the drunkards” is: \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} 
\begin{compactenum}
\item An old song (see Noah, Gen. 9:21).
\item An expensive song (eight billion a year in America for the damage done compared to three million a year during Prohibition).
\item A suggestive song (it accompanies fornication, adultery, and pornography; see Gal. 5:19--20; Heb. 2:15--16).
\item A song that is easily learned (it is promoted by TV night and day, and fermented liquor is served in the Catholic “mass”).
\item A continuous song (it has accompanied the demise of every nation that “went down the
tube”).

The One who was accustomed to the praise of seraphim and cherubim and angelic choirs (Job 38:1–5; Isa. 6:2–4) became the butt of a deadly joke (Matt. 27:29). To this day the Jews take Him to be a sorcerer who was born out of wedlock and whose body was stolen from the tomb. To this day Catholics think they can swallow Him Sunday morning after keeping “Him” locked up in a little “holy of holies” in a “tabernacle” in a Catholic building. And these days (1990) He is pictured as immersed in urine (homosexuals who practice “the golden stream” would “dig” this kind of a picture), shacking up with Mary Magdalene, and acting like a neurotic teenager (Jesus Christ, Superstar). Every person involved in these obscene jokes is a heavy drinker, and most of them are dopeheads.}

In the context it is Christ’s prayer to the Father (see Heb. 5:7), which is apparent by the next two verses. (see the Commentary on The Pastoral Epistles, Titus 1:1--2). Spiritually speaking, an “acceptable time” for the child of God is: \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms} 
\begin{compactenum}
\item Early in the morning (Ps. 5:3).
\item At a time when Christ’s blood has covered the sins of the petitioner (Ps. 51:4).

\item At a time when God can get the glory if the prayer is answered (Ps. 50:15).

The “truth” of God’s salvation is (in Christ’s case) that:
\begin{compactenum}
\item God had promised Him everlasting life before Genesis 1:1.
\item God could save Him from death and resurrect Him after He was dead (Ps. 16:10).
\item God, in order to be true (Rom. 3:4), had to save mankind Himself (Gen. 22:8 in the
Authorized Version: it is not found in the “Dead Rat Otherism” of Bob Jones University).
\end{compactenum}
In the case of the sinner, the acceptable time is when “grace” comes by Jesus Christ (not Paul), where the “truth of thy salvation” is Jesus Christ Himself (“the way, the truth and the life,” John 14:6), to whom a man must come before God will have “mercy” on him (Rom. 9:15)—“multitude of thy mercy” (vs. 13).}

missing all the references and all the applications due to their “Dead Duck Otherism” (a heresy of
the Alexandrian cult promoted at Bob Jones University). This is the teaching that you can find
everything in “the original Greek” or the “original Hebrew,” and the RV, ASV, NASV, RSV, NRSV,
NIV, and NKJV, that you can find in an

\item This is why the first four soul winners are fishermen (John 1:40).
\item This is why John is immersing when the Lord shows up, and this is why the Lord lets him baptize Him (Matt. 3:14–15).
\item Water baptism is thus a picture of the wrath of God falling on a condemned sinner and drowning him in darkness (see Gen. 1:2). 
\item This is why Jesus Christ speaks of a “baptism” in the future (after His literal water baptism) which is a baptism of suffering unto death (see Matt. 20:22). He took the place of the condemned sinner under the wrath of God.

All the commentators miss all the verses, all of
the doctrines, all of the revelations, and all the
applications. The blockheads at Bob Jones
University and Baptist Bible College are just as
much “in the dark” as the worst unsaved Liberal in
the National Council of Communist Churches.
The “waters” come into his “soul” (vs. 1), and
the “bars” of the earth are about Jonah “forever”
(see Jonah 2:6). It is the “deep” and the “pit”
that we are dealing with—see verse 15. The
prayer is the prayer of Hebrews 5:7 (see the
Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles, Titus 1:1–
2).
With these Christological and Soteriological
doctrines stated clearly and their Messianic
imports interpreted in the King James Authorized
Version, Delitzsch, Keil, Harkavy, Ewald, and
Hupfeld bomb out with “the Hebrew”; Zodhiates,
Robertson, Davis, Trench, Mache, and Rendall
bomb out with “the Greek”; Jamieson, Fausset,
Brown, Lange, Clarke, Ellicott, Motyer, Yates,
Kroll, and Duhm bomb out with the English; and
Bob Jones IV, Kutilek, Sumner, Hudson, Hutson,
Price, Martin, Afman, Walker, Melton, MacRae,
Hodges, and Farstad bomb out with “the best
texts.”
Par for the course.
“The waters of sorrow that remained outside
the Psalmist’s life would be disturbing, but those
which made their way into the hold of his life
would be disastrous.”
That is the “meat” you will get at Liberty
University (Kroll). Kroll gets a milky application
in verses 14 and 15, but that time the cross
reference to Jonah was so obvious he couldn’t
miss it. However, he did miss the references to the
original creation, the flood, Noah, the figure of
baptism, the ministry of John, the sayings to the
two disciples (Matt. 20:22), the calling of the
disciples, the purpose of baptism, and the location
of the solar system. (No shame; so did all the men
who taught him everything he doesn’t know.)
For Dummelow “the pit” is a “metaphor for
trouble” and the “deep waters” are “understood
figuratively of danger and distress.” The New King
Jimmy Book took Christ’s “soul” away from Him
(vs. 1) right while He was pouring it out for the
revisers of “Dead Duck Otherism” just mentioned
(Isa. 53:12). The rest of the “alternate readings”
are not worth listing. Between Jamieson, Fausset,
Brown, Dummelow, Baethgen, Perowne, Briggs,
Davidson, Delitzsch, and Hengstenberg there is
about eighteen changes in the first six verses: three
per verse. Spurgeon spiritualizes all four verses (1,
2, 14, 15) although he recognizes they are
Messianic.}

In Christ’s case it is three days after He is crucified. I have claimed this promise, and deliverance never did come. (I presume it will come at the rapture, “better late than never.”) Moses gets his prayer answered (Deut. 3:25) 1500 years after the first petition. Spurgeon is right when he says you can pray this prayer, but you had better add “nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.” Chances are ten to one that “His will” will be slower than yours, if it matches yours at
all. Speedy deliverances have taken place. No mature Christian gets through twenty years of
converted life without seeing them occasionally. There are miraculous deliverances in a matter of seconds from all kinds of dangers, many of them mortal, but at other times when you are praying, you wind up in jail (Lester Roloff), bankrupt (Herman Fountain), defrocked (Bob Jones Sr.), in the hospital (many of my friends), languishing as a POW, or sitting in a wheel chair (Tim Lee). Claim what you can. Verses 17, 18, and 19 are doctrinal references to the prayers of a sinless human being. Pappy Reveal used to pray some great prayers (Evansville Rescue Mission). He would pray, “Lord, you know me and my wife have already paid our bills, and we always get them paid on the first day of the month. Now, tomorrow is the first day of the month, and our creditors need three hundred dollars. If we don’t make it this time your name is going to be MUD!” Make sure you are close to God if you talk like that. Pappy Reveal (he “ordained me” by “laying on of hands” when I left Rhodeheaver Auditorium on the Bob Jones University campus, 1953) would pray, “Lord, you’ve really blessed us these last seventeen years: we had three hundred and eleven souls saved this year, averaged that many all seventeen years we have had...ah,...we’ve had...ah, well, Lord, you figure it out.” \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

found in the Gospels (Matt. 27:34). The “gall”
was in the first dose of vinegar mixed with myrrh,
as the stupefying drink of Proverbs 31:6–7. Wine
doesn’t appear anywhere in the verse except in the
corrupt abominations published by Rome. The
NIV and the RSV try to help the old Roman liquor
heads out by inserting the word “wine” (for
“vinegar”) in Matthew 27:34, but it doesn’t do
any good, for Christ would not drink it anyway.
The remarkable thing about this corrupt reading in
the New International Version is that Nestle
cannot give any manuscript evidence for the
reading. He says it is from Psalm 69, but Psalm
69:21 does not say “wine”; it says “vinegar.”
Whence then did the lushes and the bimbos
construct this mythological reading?
According to the most “up-to-date, scientific,
critical text” used for the ASV, RV, RSV, NASV,
NRSV, and NIV, it came from cloud nine. Nestle
cannot cite one authority for the substitution. It is
strictly for liquor heads. But the liquor heads work
the wine into verse 48 again, so that Jesus Christ
will have to drink with them. The word “wine” has
been inserted into Matthew 27:48 in the NIV and
the Living Bible, as well as the New English Bible
and the New Authorized New Standard New
American New International New Revised New
New New Version.
There is no Greek authority for “wine” in verse
48 in any copy of any manuscript from any family
of manuscripts discovered on the face of this
earth. The wine drinkers have written a “Bible” to
justify winos. They had to get fermented liquor
into Jesus Christ’s mouth somehow, but since the
“new wine” of the Lord’s supper was squeezed
out of the “fruit of the vine” (Matt. 26:29) it
wouldn’t do. They finally got Him to “take a
snort” from Christian Brothers distillery (Matt.
27:48) with the help of apostate Conservatives and
apostate Fundamentalists.
Par for the course.
Our Lord takes vinegar so that He is able to
sympathize with all of those whose cup is filled
with the sharp acids of this life. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

Romans 11:9–10. Again, the reader will observe
that Paul refuses to translate word-for-word, thus
producing an UNINSPIRED TRANSLATION—
thereby debunking the bunko put out by the head
of the Bible Department at Bob Jones University
(Stewart Custer). Custer said “no translation”
could be inspired, and if you believe it could be,
you belonged to a cult called “Ruckmanism.” All
the boobies are not in the hatch.
You can guess what Origen did to the passage
when he compared it with Romans chapter 11, for
he had Romans on the table when he wrote. You
see, Romans, chapter 11 was written more than
one hundred years before Origen sat down to alter
the Hebrew Old Testament. Origen and his
buddies, engaged in producing an “inspired”
Greek Old Testament, took the word
“stumblingblock” out of Romans, chapter 11
and put it into Psalm 69; they then took the word
“recompense” out of Romans 11:9 and put it
back into Psalm 69. For “just the right touch,”
they erased “and make their loins continually to
shake” and replaced it with “and bow down
their back alway” (Romans 11:10). Having
corrected “the original Hebrew manuscripts” with
a Greek translation, they pass it off as a B.C.
Septuagint composed in 250 B.C. Bob Jones,
Tennessee Temple, BBC, Liberty University,
Wheaton, Fuller, Moody, Dallas, Louisville,
BIOLA, Pacific Coast, and Grace Seminary, fall
for it like a teenage girl falling for Michael
Jackson. These incredible dupes actually believed
Paul was quoting a B.C. LXX. }\footnote{This, with Isaiah 6:9 and 10, is the
most frequently quoted passage in the New
Testament. The idea is found in Matthew 13:15;
John 12:40; and Mark 4:12 before the
Crucifixion; it shows up again in Acts 28:25–27
when Paul is dealing with the Jews; it shows up
again in Romans 11:8 when discussing Israel and
in Luke 24:31, 45. \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

Dummelow (or Dumbelow, it is hard to tell
which) says that the verse in the LXX is freely
quoted in Acts 1:20. Not unless Acts 1:20 was
written after the Council of Nicea. The LXX
reading of Psalm 69:25 is from A.D. 330—and I
don’t mean B.C. The “their” for “him” (Judas:
Acts 1:20) rattles Kroll’s cage, so he makes no
application. Thomas Wilcocks (Spurgeon’s
Treasury) can’t handle it, and neither can Yates or
Motyer. Jamieson gets by it by saying, “what
happened to Judas can be applied to Israel and
Jerusalem”—which is a fair way of stating it.

Peter speaks of it in Acts 2:23. When the “hand of God” has touched a man (see the Commentary on Job: Job 19:21) no one has any business rubbing salt in the wound. There is a lesson here for every anti-Semitic on this earth (primarily the pope and the News Media: as surely as God put a curse on the Kennedy family, He has persecuted and wounded Israel ever since the day they rejected His Son. You have no business adding a “whit” to it. Stay out of it. If “it must needs be that offences come” (Matt. 18:7; Luke 17:1–2) don’t let them come by you. Israel is God’s possession. Keep your hands off something that belongs to God. Persecution (vs. 26) has not been the lot of just the unregenerate Jews since A.D. 35; it has been the lot of the Christian saints. In the book of Acts they are arrested, harrassed, threatened, jailed, and beheaded (Acts 12:2). For the next 250 years they are eaten by lions, burned as torches, thrown into bags filled with poisonous snakes, drowned, stabbed, beaten, mutilated, and decapitated. The Albigenses and Waldenses have their fingers and toes cut off, their tongues cut out, their breasts and genitals amputated, and have their children thrown to dogs and pigs to be eaten alive. Rome never changes. Christians in Russia (1920--1990) went through these things also, plus chopsticks hammered through their noses and ears (China), and much more. Today in America there is a rising tide of hatred by “do gooders” who worry about “hate preaching” and “hate literature.” This tide is promoted and encouraged by the NEA, CBS, NBC, Life, Time, and the Gannett newspapers. Cases are too numerous to list, although the Christian Law Association could furnish you with literally hundreds. When a journalist “writes up” any Christian news item, it is always colored in four ways—irrespective of what journalist is reporting or what outlet he is reporting for: 
\begin{compactenum}
\item “True Christianity” is Roman Catholic and Socialistic.
\item No Bible is infallible; no Bible is inerrant, and no truths are absolute: all is relative.
\item Discipline of children and moral standards are ungodly, “non-Christian,” and even criminal. No child can be forced to believe anything or do anything: this includes the Ten Commandments and homework.
\item Any negative preaching is “hate preaching,” so it is a crime to say one word against anyone who rejects the Old or New Testament as myths and legends.
\end{compactenum}
From this comes the persecution of Lester Roloff, until he had to use an unsuitable plane for a trip (the suitable one was too expensive to fly after lawyer’s fees and court costs had taken several hundred thousand dollars of God’s money from him) and wound up dead. Herman Fountain (Lucedale) is presented nationwide as a Jim Jones character by taking the testimony of one teenaged Catholic dopehead (literally: he had been on drugs for two years and was on them when he testified) and putting it on TV. Police chased children, kidnapped them without the parents’ consent, and kept the newspaper reporters confined to the courthouse (Lucedale, Mississippi) while the police rounded up the children, chasing them and grappling with them. Pastor Sileven in Nebraska was jailed along with his deacon board, and their wives had to leave the state to keep from being imprisoned. They were held without bond, bail, or “benefit of attorney,” and none were entitled to a trial by jury. The Fourteenth Amendment (refer to my twohour tape on “Separation of Church and State”) is designed to deny all Constitutional rights to any organization that tries to live or “go by” the Book. All “Constitutional rights” under the Fourteenth Amendment apply to rebellious, lazy children, homosexuals, Catholic priests, pornographic artists, muggers, atheists, rapists, evolutionary professors, Communists, “political activists,” and thieves.

The prayer is answered in
Romans 10:1–3. “Let them be blotted out of the
book of the living.” This is the book that Moses
spoke of in Exodus 32:32, and that Malachi
mentions in Malachi 3:16. It would indicate that
the names of Israelites are in a Book “from the
foundation of the world” (Rev. 13:8), but these
can be “blotted out” when they reject their
Messiah. “The book of life,” of which Paul
speaks (Phil. 4:3), has names that are entered
upon reception of Christ. These have already
“overcome” (see 1 John 4:4, 5:4), whereas those
in the Tribulation—under a faith-plus-works set
up—were either never written to start with (Rev.
13:8) or if entered, may be blotted out (Rev. 3:5).
Note again how “rightly dividing the word of
truth” (2 Tim. 2:15) can clear up “difficulties”
which Greek and Hebrew scholars have due to
their own unbelief.
In connection with Psalm 69:27–28, see Psalm
87:6; Isaiah 4:3; and Job 19:23 Spurgeon wastes
half a page trying to reconcile his Calvinism with
verse 28. His text rambles on like Nat King Cole
going through Ramblin’ Rose. “This opinion
casteth a double aspersion upon God Himself...or
that his decree is mutable, excluding those upon
their sins whom he hath formerly chosen...he that
is written after a sort may, for he is written non
secundum Dei praescientiam, sed secundum
praesentem justitiam...[if you don’t know what
you are talking about, make it sound impressive]
…so they are said to be blotted out not in respect
to God’s knowledge...but according to their
present condition...some are blotted out non
secundum rei veritatem...[yeah, and some are
blotted out fee, fie, fo, fum]...but according to
man’s opinion...so that indeed, to be blotted out
of that book...is never to have been written
there...such were not written in the beginning.”
That last piece of gobbledegook came from the
first real Roman Catholic: Aurelius Augustine.

\item It is God who sets any man “on high” (Rom 13:1).
\item It is God’s salvation that elevates a sinner higher than the highest offices on this earth (Job 5:8–11).
\item God is magnified when we give thanks (vs. 30) because it is a public acknowledgment that He is THERE and is the author of the things that make us happy.
\item Animal sacrifices, though required in the Millennium, are secondary to praise and thanksgiving (vs. 31).
\item This is the generation that “seeks His face” (vs. 32: “your heart shall live that seek God”). See the devotional comments under Psalm 9:10 and 14:2.
\item A humble man can see things (vs. 32) that a proud man cannot see. No unsaved man saw Christ when He came up from the dead (1 Cor. 15:4–8).
\item The literal, physical, and political restoration of Israel in the land of Palestine (vs. 35) is as sure to take place as the New Heaven and New Earth in Revelation, chapter 20.
