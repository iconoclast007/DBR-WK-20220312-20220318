\begin{compactenum}
    \item A lot of people are making noise today.

        \item Noise about Preferences

    \item The Psalmist said in the scripture that we as Christians need to make some noise, but make it unto God!
    \begin{compactenum}[a.]
        \item He said there is an Obligation! \\
        “Make” – We are obligated to cause the noise to happen!
        \item He said there is an Objective!
“a joyful noise” – Too many church people make a fussing noise, a bickering noise, a gossip noise, and a murmuring noise, but we need real Christians to make a joyful noise!
        \item He said there is an Object!
“unto God” – This is the part most leave out! \\
**Some make a joyful noise unto the Congregation to get a Response,  a Reaction, a Reply, or a Return! \\
**Some make a joyful noise unto Christ to Acknowledge, to Appreciate, and to Applaud Him!
    \end{compactenum}
    \item The “who” is God.  So what is the “why”?  In other words, what is it we are supposed to be making a joyful noise about?    
    \item Let me give you some things it’s worth making a joyful noise about unto God! \\

\begin{compactenum}
    \item I’m so sick seeing preachers and singers priming, pumping, and prompting people to make a joyful noise.
    \begin{compactenum}[a.]
        \item Noise about Politics
        \item Noise about Play-offs
        \item Noise about Priorities
        \item Noise about Preferences
    \end{compactenum}
    \item We have plenty to make a joyful noise about without having to be coached into it!
    \item Make a joyful noise unto the Lord about His Title, His Triumphs, His Training, His Temple, and His Thoughtfulness! 
    \item Churches have dried up and died simply because people have quit living holy and close enough to God to make a joyful noise unto God! Most can’t even make a joyful grunt!
    \item It would be easy to stand here and tell you to testify and shout and try to stir you up, but I won’t do it!  It’d be better for you to get on the altar and cry unto God until He gets all over you and He inspires you to make a Joyful Noise unto Him!\\
    **So come now and pray through until God does something in your heart!
