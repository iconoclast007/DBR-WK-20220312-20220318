\multicolumn{2}{|p{4.3in}|}{{\textcolor{jungle}{Modern translations remove the reference to David's sore, his loathsome disease also seen in Psalm 38:7.  The versions spiritualize the phrase.  Leaving the text as it stands, we have an “issue of blood” (Lev. 12:7) or pus (Lev. 15:2) that will not dry up. It is a dripping infection coming from a limb; in this case, probably from the hands. \cite{Ruckman1992PsalmsV2}}}} \\ \hline
