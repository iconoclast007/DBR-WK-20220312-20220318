\subsection{Outlines from Dave Mitchell}

\subsubsection{Holden Up from the Wombs}
David was careful to recognize the fact that he was fearfully and wonderfully made by God in the womb. He also stated in one place that God knew every finger in every toe while he was still in his mother's belly, but this psalm covers the entirety of life's journey. For me the Journey from the womb has been 55 years. That's a whopping 1734480000 seconds! David tells us that every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year of his life God was the one holding him up.
