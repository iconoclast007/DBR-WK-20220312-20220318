All thirtyfive verses describe the Second Advent, giving this  chapter of the Psalms more material on the Second Advent than any chapter in the New Testament outside of Matthew chapters 24 and 25, and Mark chapter 13. Spurgeon honestly admits that “our slender scholarship has utterly failed us, and we have had to follow a surer Guide.” (He didn’t follow Him, but at least he made a profession missing from the other commentators.) ``Its darkness in some stanzas is utterly impenetrable'' (Spurgeon, p. 136). This is true, but believing the text as it stood would have cleared up at least two dozen verses. Instead of doing this, Spurgeon runs to the dead orthodox apostate Franz Delitzsch and prints a perversion of the King James Bible (p. 148–149, Treasury) in hopes that it will reduce the reader to the level of ignorance of that Hebrew scholar. Kroll, the old backslidden apostate at Liberty University, approaches the chapter like a Ninja trying to find his way through the Ginza without being detected. He says, “most older theologians hold the Psalm to be Messianic...to some, the prophecy was so clear that they saw no historical interpretation...a more moderate and reasonable interpretation is that the Psalm is Messianic, yet has a double fulfillment seen in the history of Israel...and the history of GOD’S CHURCH as dominated by the Ascension of Christ to heaven.”  All of which means: “Little Jack Horner, over in a corner, what does your garden grow? He fell down and broke his crown, and when the pie was opened the birds began to sing.” With such a grounding, Kroll’s exposition looks like Bugs Bunny and the Road Runner in Disneyworld. He has verse 23 as a “metaphor,” where Christ is now reigning over the kingdoms of this world, and nobody shows up at the Advent in verse 17. Instead, these are the folks up in heaven around the throne. There is no literal “rain” in Kroll’s commentary (vs. 9) although this rain is mentioned seven times in connection with the literal Second Advent of Jesus Christ (1 Kings 18:41, 45; James 5:7, 17; 2 Sam. 23:4; Hosea 6:3; Ps. 68:9, etc.). Kroll’s “calves” (vs. 30) are “crocodiles” (see the Commentary on Job, Job 41), and the final fulfillment of the first Messianic promise in the Bible for the salvation of mankind is obliterated (vs. 21; Gen. 3:15). This is Fundamental, Premillennial, Christian scholarship at the end of the Church Age. “Fools and blind” (Matt. 23:17). “Let God arise!” There isn’t a Church Age reference in one word in the verse. It is the arising of Joel 3:16; Isaiah 14:22, 28:21; and Psalm 3:7, 7:6. “Let his enemies be scattered.” All efforts to deaden the prophecy by refering to a past event in Numbers 10:35, are useless for in Psalm 49:4, Numbers is said to be a parable (Ps. 78:2). It will happen again. “As smoke...wax melteth before fire...let the wicked perish.” You couldn’t miss the Biblical interpretation documented by the Holy Spirit if you couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn with a bunch of bananas. Malachi 4:1–5 defines it. Matthew 3:10, 12 define it. Second Thessalonians 1:8 defines it. Second Thessalonians 2:8 defines it. If you couldn’t read those verses or find them, “the presence of God” (vs. 2) would have settled the matter for you. There isn’t a Church Age reference or an Old Testament reference in the first six verses. Kroll blubbers and mumbles, “the prophetic prayer is that the enemies of God would be scattered before Him.” Yea, small fry, dey sho
will be!  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

There are no people called “the righteous” anywhere in the Pauline epistles or the Church Age. “The righteous” (Matt. 25:37) are Tribulation saints according to the Scripture. “By his name JAH.” The abbreviation is from “Jehovah” and it is first found in Exodus 15:2. According to Bullinger it occurs forty-nine times in the Old Testament, however, the “first occurrence” defines its application, for the first occurrence is where the first “song” in the Bible was sung (see comments under Ps. 66:2, 4, etc.). Israel had just been delivered from one of the greatest types of the Son of Perdition anywhere in the Book—a “white horse rider” (Exod. 15:1)— and from the plagues in Egypt, which picture the Tribulation plagues of Revelation 11:6. That is why “JAH” suddenly shows up again here. Kroll missed both references, both occurrences of the name, and the significance of the occurrences. (With buddies like Harold Willmington, Sumner Wemp, Elmer Towns, Edward Dobson, Ed Hindson, Stephen Schrader, and Elmer Jantz, how could he do anything but miss?)  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

All of the commentators missed all of the references. Spurgeon directs you to “deserts” for “heavens,” and nobody “rides” anything. It is figurative. This is the result of listening to another Bible-rejecting Nicolaitan (Delitzsch) instead of believing the Book, for Delitzsch had corrected the Holy Spirit with “for Him who rideth along through the steppes.” Success: the reader was brought down to Delitzsch’s level of ignorance, and so was anyone stupid enough to think that his Hebrew scholarship would produce anything but a mud pie. “God in his holy habitation” judged the fatherless and widows of Matthew 25:35–36 mentioned in Job 22:9, and brought them out as Hannah foretold it in 1 Samuel 2:4–8.

A Hebrew or Greek scholar, on the other hand, might have a terrible time with it—and boy, do they ever!—but a believing heart and a humble mind couldn’t find one obscure item in all six verses. To help us out is our good old friend “Selah” (vs. 7). Kyle Yates says the passage is a description of Exodus chapter 20 and ends at Ephesians 4:8, so the whole thing is in the past. Dummelow puts the whole thing in the past, and so the “rain” of verse 9 must represent “all the blessings of the sojourn in the wilderness.” Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown say the “ulterior” reference is to the Holy Spirit, and then put the whole passage into the past. Liberty University (Kroll), swept away with the flood of stupidity and unbelief of the “majority of conservative scholars,” cries out in hysterical lunacy: “This is not meant to be a literal rain, but rather a shower of blessings” (agh, go soak your head in Kool-Aid). It is literal in 2 Samuel 23:4. It is literal in James 5:17–18. It is literal in 1 Kings 18:41. It is literal in Hosea 6:3. And it is literal in Joel 2:23. You just don’t know where you’re at, Kroll; but then again, you don’t know what you are reading or what you are doing, so we’ll overlook your infidelity.

Read your Bible. There is nothing like a Bible to clear up “the original, verbally inspired autographs.” “The poor” are those of James 2:5--6 and Matthew 25:31--40 at the Advent, as declared in Psalms 9:18, 10:2, 8--9; 12:5, etc. All the commentators missed all the verses. When Kroll sees the end of verse 10, he checks out; no comment. Motyer checks out. Yates checks out. Dummelow checks out. J. Peter Lange and Adam Clarke check out. And Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown check out. Jamieson makes an attempt—“the poor are the once homeless Israelites in the wilderness.” But “golden earrings” (Exod. 32:2), “butter, kine, sheep, goats, and the “pure blood of the grape” (Deut. 32:14) are not exactly “po’ folk’s” fare. It is interesting to note that of the complaining going on in the wilderness (ten murmurings), no one ever complains about being “poor.” They complain about water, fish, onions, and garlic. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown get out of it by saying “Thy congregation hath dwelt therein” refers to the poor folks getting rich in the land of Canaan, but Spurgeon’s Treasury says, no, the “therein” is in the wilderness. Neither one will do for the context. Bullinger decides to make the word “poor” apply to the nation of Israel as “the oppressed one” or “the humbled ones,” but this isn’t Exodus through Numbers; the only one oppressing them there—outside of one attack by the Amalekites—is God.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}

\item The Lord returns to Mount Sinai at the Advent, and it melts.
\item He marches through the wilderness ahead of Israel, through Mount Paran and Mount Seir.
\item This is signalled by two seasons of literal rain coming down in one month (Joel 2:23), heralding the end of the Tribulation—the three and a half years of “dryness” that came through the preaching of Elijah (Rev. 11:6).
\item There are signs in the heavens when this takes place (Acts 2:19--20).
\item “The poor” are Israelites who have been stripped of house, home, land, family, property, money, food, and clothing (Matt. 25:35--36) by the Son of Perdition. It is God’s “goodness” that repays them at the Advent.

In the Tribulation, “the word” comes by Moses and Elijah (Rev. 11:3) and goes quickly to one hundred forty-four thousand literal Jews, and hence to “a great multitude which no man could number” (Rev. 7:9). Kroll (Liberty University) misses both applications and gives you some nonsense from Numbers and Joshua about “When God sounded the battle cry from the ark of the covenant, a great company roused the troops of Israel to fight.” Struck out again; zero for three. If Kroll threw his ball bat down he would miss the ground. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown can’t do anything with it, so they alter it to “great is the company of the female heralds.” Then, without even knowing what they are doing, they run it to Exodus chapter 15 and Judges chapter 5, where the context located Psalm 68: it was the Second Advent in all three places. The word “published” here means simply to proclaim, but it is amazing how the AV of 1611 gives you advanced revelations in “archaic” words. Those who “published” the word turned out to be World Publishing Company, Oxford, Cambridge, Thomas Nelson and Sons, Bearing Precious Seed, the Trinitarian Bible Society, Pensacola Bible Institute, and then, in some fashion, Baker, Zondervan, Eerdmans, Random House, the Sword of the Lord, and a dozen more.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}   }

The best we can do is settle for a double application. Historically, this would be the deliverance from slave labor in Egypt where Israel served as “cooks and bakers,” “washers and dryers.” They became rich with silver and gold; this happened (Exod. 12:35--36). Prophetically: the Jews will be at the end of their rope in Daniel’s Seventieth Week and will be slave laborers to the Gentiles (Lam. 2; Rev. 11:1–3; Deut. 28:48; Joel 3:6). At the Advent they will have the “wings like a dove” to fly to the wilderness (Ps. 55:6), and God will make them rich (Zech. 14:14; Rom. 11:12) after He “marches through the wilderness” (Ps. 68:7). Kroll, cloning all of his deluded peers, says “pots” should be “sheepfolds.” Well, what of it? Baethgen thinks “Let God arise” should be “God stands.” Briggs thinks “at the presence” should be “from His presence.” Duhm thinks that “extol him that rideth” should be “make way for him,” and the ASV thinks it should be “cast up a highway for him.” The Living Bible thinks “the rebellious dwell in a dry land” should be “is famine and distress.” The NIV thinks that “so drive them away” should be “away by the wind” and...but why go on? The Troll thought he could eat Daddy Billy Goats Gruff. Sylvester thought he could catch Tweety and eat him, and Wiley Coyote has been chasing Road Runner for so long that he could collect five hundred million in lawsuits for buying equipment that didn’t work. Who would give a flip what Kroll at Liberty University thinks about anything after reading The Liberty Bible Commentary? He can’t even comment on verse 14, which deals with the battle of Armageddon. The one who tarries at home divides the spoil (vs. 12) according to David’s dictum, which was simply a repetition of the of the Mosaic law (1 Sam. 30:24; Num. 31:27). The “she” here is the virgin daughter of Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 19:21 and Jer. 31:21) who did not take part in the actual “battle” described in Revelation 19:10--16; Zech. 14:1--4; and Joel, chapter 2.

One writer (on vs. 13) has said that “The changing colours of the dove’s plumage is described...I have had cause to remark the flash of the wing of a pigeon in passing before my study window, that bird has often led me to imagine that some unusual light had flashed across the sky; in every case a mild and silvery light.” We can say that God should be praised and blessed because: 
\begin{compactenum}
	\item He is the God of salvation.
	\item He is the One who causes us to benefit.
	\item He chose unworthy and ungrateful subjects to bestow benefits upon.
\end{compactenum}
Among these “benefits” are food and clothing (1 Tim. 6:8 and Acts 14:15–17), chances to be saved, chances to witness, chances to lay up treasure in heaven, opportunities to improve ourselves, plus the common blessings, the like of which thousands take for granted: the ability to run or even to walk, the ability to digest and eliminate food (which is denied to many), the ability to sing and to write, to talk and to hear, and even to see. These luxuries are taken for granted by most of the human race; but they are just that —luxuries. “You never miss the water till the well runs dry.” In addition to this, there are thousands of sinners, especially in the United States, who don’t spend more than twelve weeks in a hospital from birth to sixty years of age, and there are thousands more in America whose incomes enable them to live in three bedroom houses with three automobiles parked outside. But the obvious doctrinal reference in verse 19 is to ISRAEL (“the God of our salvation”) no one could miss it. “Selah” pops up again to clinch the matter. Israel is the one who has its “daily bread” (see Matt. 6:10--13) supplied for three and one half years (Rev. 12:6) during the drought (Rev. 11:6). And now you can prepare for a mammoth defection from the truth that would shock even the editor of the Gannett newspapers. You are about to hit two verses that will rattle the cages of every apostate Fundamentalist in the world from Origen and Bob Jones IV to Augustine and John MacArthur. The first one deals with Satan, and the next one deals with an unkind, uncharitable, rude, vicious, and brutal Jesus Christ who is not tolerated on the campus of Bob Jones University. (I am NOT speaking sarcastically. Read The Truth About the KJV Controversy, Stewart Custer [Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press, Inc., 1981], by the head of the Bible Department at Bob Jones University, pp. 29–30.) Be assured the “godly” scholars will get rid of Jesus Christ and protect the devil as quickly as they can. They won’t fail you in a “showdown.”  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

The issues of LIFE come from the heart (Prov. 4:23), but once you are dead (“and there is no discharge in that war,” Eccl. 8:8) the issues are decided by God Almighty (Rev. 20:11–13). You no longer have any say so, any opinions or suggestions, any criticisms, ideas, or any acts of will to make. Once Spurgeon hits the passage, he runs to George Phillips (1846) for help, who quickly assures us (as Hymers, Hudson, Hindson, Hobbs, Horton, Hutson, and Kutilek would) that “The English versions cannot be sustained by the Hebrew.” Good; throw the Hebrew out. The fact that we could read “issues of death” is immaterial because that, too, is in the verse the way it is stated. Of course the Lord kills and makes alive (Deut. 32:39), but “issues” are things that arise that call for decisions. If any death warrants are to be passed out, death doesn’t pass them out; God does (Heb. 2:14).  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

It was still an unfulfilled, future prophecy when Paul wrote Romans 16:20 more than twenty-five years after the Crucifixion. When the commentators “spiritualized” Genesis 3:15, they lost ten verses in the Bible that showed them what was going to happen, when it was going to happen, and who it would happen to. How reminiscent this is of their handling of Mark 1:2 in the ASV, NASV, and NIV , where all of them attacked the Deity of Christ in the “first gospel written” before it had gone three verses, and then bragged about their fidelity to the “Word of God” and their implicit faith in the “infallibility and inerrancy” of the “plenary, verbally inspired originals!” Bob Jones University and Bible Baptist College, along with Dallas, Moody, Wheaton, and Louisville, recommended the ASV and the NASV for more than forty years. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown take one long look and sign off. They write twenty lines on Edom and Bashan, Og and the Red Sea (vs. 22) but are unable to say one word—ONE WORD— on the first prophecy in the Bible outside of the Virgin Birth (Gen. 3:15, the “seed of the woman”). In goes Kroll, with Elmer Towns, Sumner Wemp, Harold Willmington, and Jerry Falwell behind him, all armed with Greek and Hebrew lexicons, commentaries, word studies, “Home Bible Studies,” Champions for Christ, the Moral Majority, and a pile of degrees that would make a thermometer jealous, and up comes...NOTHING. He mumbles, “Jehovah is the God who brings down the proud.” Get the bums off the platform. Motyer (New Bible Commentary) contracts lockjaw and can’t utter one word on any part of the text. Kyle Yates follows him with a resounding silence that echoes from “the original Hebrew text” to the LXX. Charles Haddon Spurgeon along with his friends (Francis Hare, and Edward Leigh) can only whine something about “it was a practise among some of the ancient inhabitants of Arabia to allow the hair to grow luxuriantly,” and “The most fearful enemies that with their ghastly visage, deformed with long hair, would strike terror into the heart of the beholders.” And after that write down: “Deedle deedle dumplin’ my son John, went to bed with his stockings on.” We are not going to waste any more of your time with the Scholars’ Union—that bloated, puffed up, conceited bunch of heady, highminded Nicolaitans (A. T. Robertson, Delitzsch, Keil, Harkavy, Trench, Hutson, Zodhiates, Rice, Combs, Sherman, Dell, Panosian, Bob Jones IV, et al.) who thought the sun rose and set on “historic positions” and “good, godly men.” We are simply going to reproduce the English text of the English verses, in English, where anyone could find the truth despite three hundred years of scientific research, “new light” from archaeology, “better and older” manuscripts, and more “readable” translations. Not one scholar on one revision committee from 1880 to 1993 was able to find these verses in ANY set of manuscripts.

\item “It shall bruise thy head” (Gen. 3:15). Christ will bruise the Serpent’s head.
\item “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly” (Rom. 16:20).
\item “Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked” (Hab. 3:13).
\item “He shall wound the heads over many countries” (Ps. 110:6).

With Sisera lying on the ground with a tent peg through his head, with Goliath falling before David (1 Sam. 17:49) with a stone (Dan. 2:34) imbedded in his forehead, and with Abimelech lying at Thebez with a millstone on his head (Judg. 9:53), you would think that someone would get the message. All the commentators missed all the references, AGAIN. Christ was crucified in the “place of a skull” (Matt. 27:33). Not even Bullinger could find the advanced revelation given in 1611 which not one Hebrew or Greek scholar in one Conservative college or Fundamentalist university could find in 1993. It was concealed in the Elizabethean English and could not be detected with three hundred and eighty years of scholarship, although it dealt with the fulfillment of the first promise of salvation given to the human race. Par for the course. No one is more blind and more stupid than a “recognized, qualified, godly, conservative scholar” who thinks he is smart enough to correct the Book. The “feet” that Paul mentioned in the New Testament (Rom. 16:20) show up within two verses of the “wounding of the head.” “That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies.” But this a “no-no” for the effeminate head of the Bible Department at Bob Jones University. The “sweet, nice, polite, kind Jesus” of Bob Jones University is not the Jesus Christ of the Book (see The Truth about the KJV Controversy, p. 30).  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

His literal feet, and the literal blood is so literally deep that it literally splashes on YOUR feet as you ride behind the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. All of the commentators missed all the references, either because of stupidity, or (as in the case of deliberate censorship) because of cowardice. It would hurt their scholastic image if anyone found out that they really believed in such things. No commentator has one Scriptural contribution to make to the passage. The “depths of the sea” in the passage refers to the “heap of great waters” (Hab. 3:15), which are above the heavens (see Ps. 148:4 and Gen. 1:7), and this is the “sea” of Job 41:31 and Revelation 20:1–2. Because it is the abode of Satan (Job 41:32), the commentators are anxious to get rid of it and protect him; they all do. With Isaiah 27:1–2 in front of their faces and the post-Tribulation rapture described as an ascent through water (“astronaut,” remember)—2 Samuel 22:17; Psalm 18:16, 29:3, 33:7—not one commentator, of any profession or persuasion, could find one Biblical truth in the passage. This is the result of “Christian education” on the college level. It breeds pride (1 Cor. 8:1), cowardice (John 12:43), and infidelity (John 5:44–47). Every commentator had training in textual criticism, manuscript evidence, Hebrew, Greek, and systematic theology. They could no more handle an English Bible in their own language than they could handle a rabid, wild cat. And you had better understand something: this is the bunch that sings, The Battle Hymn of the Republic, which is taken from the verses given above, except in The Battle Hymn, Yankees are stomping on WHITE SOUTHERNERS .That’s the bunch. That is how they interpreted Isaiah chapter 63 and Revelation chapter 14; they were “kingdom builders.” All kingdom builders are bloody killers.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

The scholars still didn’t get it, not even with Matthew 5:35 and 25:34 in front of them in the English. What follows is the real triumphal procession that will take place when the Lord Jesus Christ goes up to Mount Zion and sits down on the throne of David (Luke 1:30--34), and all of the previous blather from the commentators about the “ark ascending with David and Solomon” was just rubbish. They tried to historicize the Psalm on the grounds that it had to have a literal historical application. It doesn’t. Psalm 22 certainly didn’t: David never had his hands and feet pierced. Verse 25 shows the reaction of Exodus, chapter 15, literally. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown are quick to tell you that verse 26 should “rather” be—Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown should be called the Rather Commentary. Rather than believe what is written, Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown say “rather” more than one hundred times in the Book of Psalms, and then alter the text. Kroll can’t even attempt to expound “the fountain of Israel” (vs. 26). Spurgeon makes the ark the fountain. A much truer exposition would recognize that the “fountain of the water of Nephtoah” (Josh. 15:9) is in Jerusalem and is associated with the valley of Hinnon and the “valley of the giants” (Josh. 15:8). Nehemiah speaks about “the gate of the fountain” (Neh. 2:14). The following items are connected with this “fountain.”  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }

This signifies doctrinally, a post-Tribulation rapture (see Matt. 25:10). Verse 3 is selfexplanatory. The cloud that hung over Moses’ wilderness tabernacle will abide over the Millennial temple (Isa. 4:5). “His strength is in the clouds” (vs. 34): in the sense that He rides on them (Isa. 19:1); He comes with them (Acts 1; Rev. 1:7); His presence is associated with a cloud (Ezek. 10:3; 1 Kings 8:10), and He uses them for purposes which no meteorologist has figured out yet (Job 36:27--33, 37:11--16). “O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places” (vs. 35). Although Kroll can’t expound one word in the sentence, he at least grasps the truth that verses 31 through 34 refer to the Millennial reign of Christ, and for him that is a giant step of faith!  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}

The corrupt scholars of the corrupt NIV thought it was. Ditto the revisers of the RSV and the Living Bible: they all converted it to a singular, losing all of the Biblical references. And here ends the greatest chapter on the Second Coming in the entire Old Testament. “Blessed be God.” It stands in the English Text of the AV as a monument to the stupidity, infidelity, and blindness of Conservative and Evangelical scholarship. Every verse in it that demanded belief was rejected and altered to fit the private interpretation of some Bible-correcting Nicolaitan who was wasting his life trying to impress the Body of Christ as a “God-called” interpreter. These are verses 1, 4, 6--7, 9, 17, 21--23, and 30.  \cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}  }
