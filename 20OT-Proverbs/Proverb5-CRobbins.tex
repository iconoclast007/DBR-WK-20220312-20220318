\subsection{Notes from Chris Robbins}
\textbf{Theme: }The invitation to worship God as a means of finding our resting place.\footnote{\href{http://pastorchrisrobbins.blogspot.com/search?q=Psalm+95}{Chris Robbins' notes on Psalm 95} }\\
\\
\textbf{Historical Insight: }This is an anonymous Psalm. Meribah, which means “quarreling,” and Massah, which means “testing,” refers to the incident of wilderness wandering in Rephidim when the Israelites complained to Moses on account of having no water to drink (Exodus 17:1-7, Numbers 20:1-13).

\subsection*{Application} Christ Jesus is the Rock of our salvation, which makes us joyful, thankful, and exuberant. He is above all other gods and owns everything. Let us worship our Maker and kneel before His presence in faith for He is our God. Do not harden or err in your heart against this Creator and despise His ways. This is a rebellion with Him, a quarrel against Him and a test of Him. If you do, you will incur His loathing, and He swears against you that you will not enter into His temporal nor eternal rest (Psalm 95:11, Hebrews 3:7-19).
