\noindent \textbf{Introduction: } Friends make this life much more enjoyable. There is nothing like serving the Lord with brothers and sisters in Christ. Maybe you fish, hunt, or enjoy other types of activities with those you cherish in this life. We all have special people in our lives that we love to spend time with; however, our best friend should always be the Lord Jesus Christ. In times of trouble, grief, sorrow, and despair, Jesus has been there for you and I. In times of joy, happiness, excitement, and gain, Jesus has been there for you and I!
Notice several things with me about this friendship you and I ought to cherish:
