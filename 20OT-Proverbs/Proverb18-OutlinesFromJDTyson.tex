\noindent  \textbf{Introduction: } How many of you have friends? How about close friends? How many of you ever lost a friend (other than by death)? How about a close friend? Someone said we can count our true friends on one hand. Having a true friend is really more rare than we think. But the Bible tells us about the Lord Jesus Christ, a true friend, one, who as this passage says, ``sticks closer than a brother.'' Let us look at six things about this true friend, using the letters of the word friend.
\begin{compactenum}[I.]
    \item A Limitless Friend – Matt 9:9-12
    \item A Loving Friend – John 11:1-11; 33-36
    \item A Loyal Friend – Matt 26:47-50
    \item A Lenient Friend – John 21:15-19
    \item A Life-giving Friend – John15:13
\end{compactenum}
