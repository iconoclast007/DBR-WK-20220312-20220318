\begin{compactenum}[I.][8]
    \item \textbf{Unwanted Family} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:01}(Pro 17:1)  a home full of strife and contention... it is better to be poor and happy 
    \item \textbf{Unteachable Fool} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:10}(Pro 17:10) Have you ever been one of these? If you are a Christian, we have a faithful and dedicated teacher, who will not cease the lesson until it is learned.  
    \item \textbf{Unstoppable Fool} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:11}(Pro 17:11)  Hell has no fury as a woman scorned or as a fool with a mission... if history only recorded the damage done by unfettered stupidity 
    \item \textbf{Unrestrained Fanatic} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:11}(Pro 17:11) often in self-righteous and religious zeal  
    \item \textbf{Uncontrollable Flood} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:14}(Pro 17:14)  once the finger is taken out of the hole on the dike the flood will come... There will be damage, there will be hurt, things will be irrecoverably affected 
    \item \textbf{Unshakeable Fealty} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:17}(Pro 17:17)  another word for loyalty is fealty 
    \item \textbf{Unfulfilled Father} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:21}(Pro 17:21) - - the father of fool Proverbs 17 
    \item \textbf{Unobtainable Focus} \index[scripture]{Proverbs!Pro 17:24}(Pro 17:24)  the fool ever seeking and not finding, he has no roots, he has no reason, there is no rhyme in his life... a fool is often one who never settles down, always jumping from one thing to another.
