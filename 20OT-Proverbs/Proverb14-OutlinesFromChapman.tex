\textbf{Introduction}:  In Proverbs 14:12, the Bible says, ``There is a way that seemeth right unto a man.'' And in Proverbs 14:14 it says, ``The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways.'' Many think that sincerity is all that is needed. Sometimes it is not such a terrible thing to get on a wrong highway, but when it is the road that leads to God and service for Him, it is a very serious matter. Here are some reasons that may lead a person to go astray.
