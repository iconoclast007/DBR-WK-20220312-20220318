\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.}\\

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, \emph{the} \emph{priests} going on, and blowing with the trumpets.}

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the city shall be accursed, \emph{even} it, and all that \emph{are} therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that \emph{are} with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.}
[18] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And ye, in any wise keep \emph{yourselves} from the accursed thing, lest ye make \emph{yourselves} accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.}
[19] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, \emph{are} consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.}
[20] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So the people shouted when \emph{the} \emph{priests} blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.}
[21] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they utterly destroyed all that \emph{was} in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.}
[22] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.}
[23] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.}
[24] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they burnt the city with fire, and all that \emph{was} therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.}
[25] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel \emph{even} unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.}
[26] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Joshua adjured \emph{them} at that time, saying, Cursed \emph{be} the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest \emph{son} shall he set up the gates of it.}
[27] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was \emph{noised} throughout all the country.}
