the other half of the tribe of Manasseh. Notice
how the name “Gilead” is used in verse 1.
When it says Gilead “was a man of war,” the
reference isn’t to the individual; it’s talking
about the people named after the individual.
You see the same thing with the name Jacob
over and over again in the prophets where it’s
referring to the nation of Israel, not the
patriarch (e.g., Isa. 9:8, 10:21, 17:4, 27:9,
29:22, 40:27, 41:8, 43:1, 44:1–2, 48:12).
Gilead the man would have been long since
dead by the time the Israelites took the lands of
Gilead and Bashan, for he was “brought up on
Joseph’s knees” (Gen. 50:23 cf. Num. 26:29),
and no one over the age of twenty at the time
the spies gave the evil report made it into the
Promised Land but Joshua and Caleb (Num.
14:29–30). When you read the account of
Jephthah and the Gileadites whipping
Ephraimites in battle in Judges 12, you can
understand why “Gilead . . . was a man of
war.”}
[2] \footnote{“The male children of Manasseh” (vs. 2)
turn out to be great grandchildren (see vs. 3).
The line runs Manasseh, Machir, Gilead, and
then Gilead’s sons: Jeezer (Abiezer here in
Josh. 17:2), Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Shemida,
and Hepher (Num. 26:29–32). It is the families
of these great grandchildren of Manasseh who
settle in Canaan. (1 Chron. 7:15–17 lists some
other sons of Gilead, and these may have been
the ones who settled on the east side of Jordan.)
Now the use of the word “son” or
“children” is something to keep in mind when
talking about apparent “contradictions” in the
Bible. A “son” or a “child” may not be the
immediate offspring of a father at all. It can be
used of a grandson, a great grandson, a distant
descendant, a son-in-law, an adopted or foster
son, or anyone in a line of succession. You are either a child of disobedience,
a child of wrath, with the Devil as your father
(Eph. 2:2–3; John 8:44); or you have been born
again by incorruptible seed and are a child of
God by faith in the Son of God, with God as
your Father (1 Pet. 1:23; Gal. 3:26, 4:6). God
is concerned with lineages (there are more than
fifty chapters of genealogies in the Bible). The
question arises, then, in what family are you?}\footnote{\textbf{Ephesians 2:18--19} -- For through him we both have access
by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore
ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the
household of God.}\footnote{\textbf{Hebrews 2:13} -- And again, I will put my trust in him.
And again, Behold I and the children which
God hath given me.}\\

\P  \footnote{This passage deals with the resolution of a
problem that came up in Numbers 27. There
were six families of the Manassites that
inherited territory on the west side of Jordan in
Canaan. The problem arose that the inheritance
passed from father to son, and Hepher only had
one son, Zelophehad, who had no sons himself.
But Zelophehad did have five daughters, so
what was to be done with the inheritance of the
family of Hepher?
When the girls brought their predicament to
Moses, the Lord admitted they had a case. The
judgment that was given in Numbers 27:8–11
was that in the case where a man had no son,
the daughter could receive the land; where a
man had no children at all, his brothers could
get the land; and where he was an “only child,”
his next of kin got the land. From this judgment
came the law of the kinsman redeemer (Deut.
25:7–10) which plays such a pivotal role in the
book of Ruth as a type of New Testament
redemption. So what seems like a boring
technical matter for a probate court turns out to
be an important type of your salvation as a New
Testament believer.
Now look at a couple of those names. How
would you ladies like a name like “Hoglah”? I
know it has nothing to do with a hog (the name
in Hebrew actually means “partridge”), but it’s
funny how words come out in a different
language; it makes you wonder how some of
our names must sound in some other language.
Notice also the name “Noah.” In the
context, it’s a woman’s name, but everyone is
more familiar with the man of that name. So
some names can be for either a man or a
woman. Isn’t Francis a woman’s name? Well,
it’s a man’s name too (e.g., Francis Scott Key
and St. Francis of Assissi). If you wanted to see
a motion picture with “Marion” in it, would you
look for a French actress (Marion Cotillard) or
“The Duke” (Marion Morrison aka John
Wayne)? It could be either one. Wasn’t JFK’s
nickname “Jack”? Well, his wife’s name was
Jackie. And you can have the female country
singer Bobbie Gentry or the male baseball
player Bobby Richardson.
Do you know why that is so important?
Because there is a famous “contradiction” in the
Bible where “Timna” is Esau’s concubine in
Genesis 36:12 but his son in 1 Chronicles 1:36.
Why it never occurred to these infidels (Liberal
or Fundamental—take your pick) that it could
be both is beyond reason, given what you just
read above. Two different “Timnas” in the
same family: one the man’s wife and the other
his son. What was so hard to figure out about
that? Some people do have a time of it, don’t
they?I got a letter one time from a Seminary
student at Bob Jones University where he told
me my position on the King James was
“untenable” because of the “numerous
contradictions” in it. Then for examples, he
enclosed five sheets of material written by a
Liberal in the National Council of Churches.
What’s a ministerial student at a Fundamental
institution that’s supposed to be a “bastion of
orthodoxy” doing taking the position of an
unsaved Liberal on the Bible? And why is his
professor giving him the material to destroy
his faith in the word of God?
I wrote the kid back in my own “nice,
sweet” way and told him his professor was so
stupid that he couldn’t solve a grade-school
problem, and that if he were sitting under
someone that dumb, he might as well get out of
there and stop blowing his money down a rat
hole. Listen, people, I have students here at PBI
who never finished high school who could
handle a matter like you read above, so don’t
waste my time.
I answered four of that Seminary student’s
“contradictions” and told him if his professor
couldn’t answer the rest of them in the next
class, get rid of him; give the bum “the boot.” A
fellow like that has no business teaching Bible
to a DVBS, much less in a Seminary. Brethren,
what is the point of a man teaching the Bible
when he doesn’t believe it, thinks it is filled with
contradictions, and cannot explain the problems
in the Scriptures that an eighteen-year-old kid
could with a little tutoring?}

tribe of Manasseh on the west side of Jordan.
We have already commented on the southern
border it shared with Ephraim under 16:6–9,
which see. On the north, it shared its border
with Asher and Issachar (vs. 10), with the
Kishon River and the Valley of Jezreel being
the boundaries; the western border was the
Mediterranean coast (vs. 10). Like Ephraim,
Manasseh had cities in other tribes: in Asher it
had Dor; and in Issachar it had Beth-shean,
Ibleam, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo (vs. 11).
Bible readers will recognize the town of
Endor as the place where Saul sought the
services of a witch to bring up the spirit of
Samuel (1 Sam. 28:7–14). Megiddo, of course,
is the site of the Battle of Armageddon at the
Second Advent (Rev. 16:14–16; Zech. 12:11).}

western Manassites, but notice the compromise.
They couldn’t drive the Canaanites out, so they
put them to tribute—a subjugation tax like the
Moslems put on Christians and Jews when they
conquer a land (the jizya). (Mohammed never
had an original thought in his life. He stole the
“jizya” from here in the Old Testament just as
he stole “holy war,” praying five times a day
toward Mecca, obeying him like you would
obey God, alms-giving, etc. If Mohammed ever
did have an original thought, it died of
loneliness.) The problem was that wasn’t what
God told them to do: they were to wipe them
out. Just having them under tribute left them
open to infect Israel with false gods and idolatry
(Deut. 20:17–18), which is exactly what
happened in the book of Judges (read Judg. 1–
2).}

reading about the tribe of Manasseh, but now
both Ephraim and Manasseh come together to
Joshua. Notice “the children of Joseph” in
verse 14; that’s both Manasseh and Ephraim
(vs. 17).
“Why hast thou given me but one lot and
one portion to inherit . . .” (vs. 14). That
wasn’t true. Ephraim got one portion, and
Manasseh got another portion just above it.
And if that weren’t enough, Manasseh got a
second portion on the east side of Jordan, so
that was three portions for Joseph’s tribes.
“. . . seeing I am a great people.” That’s
pride operating there. If it’s a reference to the
tribes’ numbers, it’s absolutely false. According
to the census taken back in Numbers 26,
Manasseh had a smaller population than either
Issachar or Zebulun to the north that received
much less territory; Ephraim had fewer people
than Benjamin, which had a smaller inheritance
than Ephraim.
Now what was the problem? They weren’t
appreciative of the blessings God had given
them. They admit, “forasmuch as the LORD
hath blessed me hitherto.” That’s the first true
thing they’ve said, but they aren’t talking about
the land God just gave them in the lot. They’re
talking about their stuff: the spoils they took in
battle. They’re like that rich fool in Luke
12:16–17. They had more territory (and
arguably better land) than any of the other
tribes, but they wanted more.}

hill (Mt. Ephraim) is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land
of the valley have chariots of iron.'' Instead of  claiming the promises of God like Caleb did
back in chapter 14, they continue to whine and
make excuses. Those chariots meant nothing back in
Joshua 11, and later on in Judges 4 they won’t
mean anything either. Those Israelites had
something better than iron chariots; they had
God on their side if they had just claimed the
promises He made back in chapter 1.}
[18] \footnote{Of course Joshua doesn' say that. Joshua tries to motivate them to take action. “And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph . . . thou are a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only: But the mountain shall be thine . . .” (vss. 17--18). Joshua has the faith that they will ``drive out the Canaanites'' even when they don’t. Now Christian, when it looks like the odds are stacked against you and victory is impossible, you have some promises that will get you through if you claim them and act on them (and of course, I am talking about in your war against sin, the flesh, the world, and the Devil; I am not talking about “health and wealth”).}
