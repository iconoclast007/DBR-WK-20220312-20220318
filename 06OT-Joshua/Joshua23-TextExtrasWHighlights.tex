[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Joshua called for \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} Israel, \emph{and} for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old \emph{and} stricken in age:}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And ye have seen \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} that \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} hath done unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} these nations because of you; for \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} \emph{is} he that hath fought for you.}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God}, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} hath promised unto you.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom \emph{to} the right hand or \emph{to} the left;}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear \emph{by} \emph{them}, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:}
[8] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But cleave unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God}, as ye have done unto this day.}
[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but \emph{as} \emph{for} you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.}
[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{One man of you shall chase a thousand: for \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God}, he \emph{it} \emph{is} that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God}.}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, \emph{even} these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Know for a certainty that \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} will no more drive out \emph{any} \emph{of} these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} hath given you.}
[14] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And, behold, this day I \emph{am} going the way of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the earth: and ye know in \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} your hearts and in \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} your souls, that not one thing hath failed of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the good things which \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} spake concerning you; \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} are come to pass unto you, \emph{and} not one thing hath failed thereof.}
[15] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Therefore it shall come to pass, \emph{that} as \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} good things are come upon you, which \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God} hath given you.}
[16] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{When ye have transgressed the covenant of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the LORD your God}, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.}
