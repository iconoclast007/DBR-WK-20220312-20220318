[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD said unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}, The people that \emph{are} with thee \emph{are} too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Now therefore go to, proclaim \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever \emph{is} fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{mount} Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{remained} ten thousand.}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD said unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}, The people \emph{are} yet \emph{too} many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, \emph{that} of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the number of \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{them that lapped}, \emph{putting} their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the LORD said unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the \emph{other} people go every man unto his place.}
[8] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So the people took victuals \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} \emph{the} \emph{rest} \emph{of} Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host} of \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{Midian} was beneath him \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} the valley.}\\
\\
\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host}; for I have delivered it into thine hand.}
[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host}:}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host}. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that \emph{were} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host}.}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the Midianites and the Amalekites and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the children of the east lay along \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} the valley like \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{grasshoppers for multitude}; and their camels \emph{were} without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.}
[13] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And when \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon} was come, behold, \emph{there} \emph{was} a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host} of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.}
[14] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And his fellow answered and said, This \emph{is} nothing else save the sword of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon} the son of Joash, a man of Israel: \emph{for} into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host}.}\\
\\
\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And it was \emph{so}, when \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon} heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host} of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host} of Midian.}
[16] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And he divided the three hundred men \emph{into} three companies, and he put a trumpet \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.}
[17] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be \emph{that}, as I do, so shall ye do.}
[18] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{When I blow with a trumpet, I and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} that \emph{are} with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the camp, and say, \emph{The} \emph{sword} of the LORD, and of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}.}\\
\\
\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{So \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}, and the hundred men that \emph{were} with him, came unto the outside of the camp \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{trumpets}, and brake the pitchers that \emph{were} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} their hands.}
[20] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} their left hands, and the trumpets \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} their right hands to blow \emph{withal}: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon}.}
[21] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they stood every man \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} his place round about the camp: and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host} ran, and cried, and fled.}
[22] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host}: and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{the host} fled to Beth-shittah \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{in} Zererath, \emph{and} to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.}
[23] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.}\\
\\
\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon} sent \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{messengers} throughout \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{all} the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.}
[25] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{Gideon} on the other side Jordan.}
