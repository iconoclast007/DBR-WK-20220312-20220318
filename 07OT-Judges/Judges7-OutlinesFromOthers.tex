\textbf{Introduction:} In a day when it seems that the majority rule, God shows that often the minority are the ones who know the will of God better. In our church we have around 400 people but there is a core group of a few people that seem to be among the biggest supporters of God's work $\hdots$ Thank God for the true blue few that are faithful, fighting, and fervent in their faith!
