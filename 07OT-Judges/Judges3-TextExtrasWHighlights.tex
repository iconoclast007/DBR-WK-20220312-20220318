[19] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But he himself turned again from the quarries that \emph{were} by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.}
[20] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of \emph{his} seat.}
[21] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:}

[23] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.}
[24] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour \emph{were} locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.}
