[2] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name \emph{was} Manoah; and his wife \emph{was} barren, and bare not.}
[3] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou \emph{art} barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.}
[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean \emph{thing}:}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.}\\

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance \emph{was} like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he \emph{was}, neither told he me his name:}
[7] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean \emph{thing}: for the child shall be a Nazarite \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} God from the womb \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} the day of his death.}\\

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.}
[9] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And God hearkened \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband \emph{was} not with her.}
[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the \emph{other} day.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} the man, and said unto him, \emph{Art} thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I \emph{am}.}
[12] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Manoah said, Now let thy words come \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} pass. How shall we order the child, and \emph{how} shall we do unto him?}

[16] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he \emph{was} an angel of the LORD.}
[17] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What \emph{is} thy name, that when thy sayings come \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} pass we may do thee honour?}

[21] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{But the angel of the LORD did no more appear \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} Manoah and \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{to} his wife. Then Manoah knew that he \emph{was} an angel of the LORD.}
